							<h2><a href="blog.aspx">Coffee Geeks</a></h2>
							<p>
								"Me" blogs may have had their real moment in the middle of the last decade, but a new wave of specialized and thematic online projects focus less on the mundane details of a barista's daily drudgery and more on particular aspects of the coffee-loving life. From fashion-through-a-coffee-filter to a quietly opinionated espresso diary, here are five of our favorite blogs about beans (and the drink they make possible.)

                            Who says the above-shot of food and drinks is over? Not Mike White, the espresso-obsessed iPhone photographer behind this oddly mesmerizing Tumblr of just-emptied demitasse cups. There's something very Zen, if also very caffeinated, about the long scroll of pictures, and scanning through them a reader can very easily lose an hour before she knows what hit her

							<h2><a href="blog.aspx">A Caffea Day</a></h2>
							<p>
							For as long as I've been drinking coffee, I've been a firm believer in imbibing while learning. Clearly any academic or scholarly venue becomes better ten fold with a cup of good coffee in hand. This applied firmly to classes in college, small group Bible discussion, all-night cramming and by far the most pleasant, museum visits. Especially with Philadelphia institutions, I would always make an out-of-the-way stop for some great coffee before wandering the Academy of Natural Sciences or the Franklin Institute.
