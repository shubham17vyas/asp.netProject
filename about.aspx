						<h3>Best Quality Authentic Coffee Roasts!</h3>
						<p>
							The oldest of its kinds, our bistro offers great service and a treat for your taste buds.
                            We create ours with thoughtful ingredients to match whatever you’re in the mood for. Try one today paired with your favorite coffee or espresso drink.
                        Years of focus and expertise have led to our Roast Spectrum. Each coffee bean requires a unique balance of temperature and time to reach its individual peak of aroma, acidity, body and flavor. Our coffees are classified by three roast profiles – Blonde Roast, Medium Roast and Dark Roast – so you can easily find the flavor and intensity that’s perfect for you.
